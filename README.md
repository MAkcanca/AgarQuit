# AgarQuit
Basic hosts file editor with a button in Windows Form / C#

- Forces to use it with Administrator rights / highestavailable ( see app.manifest )
- Adds a new line to block Agar.io / redirects it to 127.0.0.1 ( adds new line to Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts )
- Opens up a URL when proccess is done

This project has no idea about optimized and organized code. I strongly suggest editing it before using it.
