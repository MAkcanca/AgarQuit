# AgarQuit
[Screenshot](https://github.com/MAkcanca/AgarQuit/raw/master/screenshot.png?raw=true)
Basic hosts file editor with a button in Windows Form / C#

- Forces to use it with Administrator rights / highestavailable ( see app.manifest )
- Adds a new line to block Agar.io / redirects it to 127.0.0.1 ( adds new line to Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts )
- Opens up a URL when proccess is done (surprise)

This project has no idea about optimized and organized code. 
I strongly suggest that, edit/review the whole code before using it.
